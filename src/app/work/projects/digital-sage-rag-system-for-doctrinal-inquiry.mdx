## Research Topic

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) System for Doctrinal Inquiry within the Swaminarayan Sampradaya Using Gujarati Scriptures.

## Motivation & Project Details

This research addresses the challenge of doctrinal confusion that can arise from varied interpretations of complex religious texts. The goal is to develop a trustworthy AI-powered tool that provides clear, unbiased answers to spiritual and lifestyle questions, grounded directly in foundational scriptures like the Vachanamrut and Shikshapatri.

The core of this project is to build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. This architecture ensures that the AI's responses are not "hallucinated" but are based on verifiable information retrieved from a digitized corpus of the original Gujarati scriptures. A key output will be the ability for the system to cite the specific source text for each answer, making it a reliable resource for study and clarification. This project combines interests in trustworthy AI, cultural preservation, and the unique challenges of low-resource language processing.
