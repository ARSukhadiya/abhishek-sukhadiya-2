## Objective

To create a service for sharing and storing data efficiently across different platforms. This implementation uses data compression to reduce the size of the stored data.

## Features

- **FastAPI Backend**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs.
- **Data Compression**: Uses zlib to compress data before storing it, achieving significant reductions in data size.
- **SQLite Database**: A lightweight, file-based database for easy setup and portability. The application is designed to be easily adaptable to other SQL databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.
