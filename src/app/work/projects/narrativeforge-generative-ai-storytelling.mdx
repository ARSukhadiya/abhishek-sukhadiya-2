## Project Overview

NarrativeForge is an interactive "choose your own adventure" style storytelling application where the narrative is dynamically generated by a large language model (LLM). Users make choices, and the AI generates the next part of the story, creating a unique narrative experience every time.

## Features

- **Dynamic Story Generation**: AI-powered narrative creation using state-of-the-art language models.
- **Interactive Choices**: Multiple choice system for story progression.
- **Narrative Consistency**: Smart context management to maintain story coherence.
- **Cross-Platform**: Python backend with native iOS Swift frontend.
- **Real-time Generation**: Asynchronous story generation with loading indicators.
- **Story Persistence**: Save and resume your adventures.

## Architecture

- **Backend (Python)**:
  - **LLM Integration**: Hugging Face Transformers with open-source models.
  - **Prompt Engineering**: Sophisticated prompt system for creative, consistent storytelling.
  - **Context Management**: Smart conversation history management.
  - **REST API**: FastAPI for iOS communication.
- **Frontend (iOS Swift)**:
  - **Native UI**: SwiftUI for modern, responsive interface.
  - **Interactive Choices**: Touch-based story progression.
  - **Async Communication**: Seamless backend integration.
  - **Story Display**: Rich text rendering with animations.

## ML Components

- **Language Model**: Hugging Face Transformers with Llama/Mistral.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom prompt templates for story generation.
- **Context Management**: Intelligent conversation history handling.
- **Choice Generation**: AI-powered choice creation system.
